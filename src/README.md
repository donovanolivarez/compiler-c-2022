# Lexical Analyzer - Part 1 - Donovan Olivarez

Program is written using C. Tested on the fox servers. Working for all .frag and .decaf files.

# Build and Run
You can build from either the root directory (src) or workdir:

    ./workdir/build.sh

    or 

    cd workdir
    ./build.sh

Lexer binary is created in src directory.
Exec can accept a filepath as a parameter.

Pass option '-all' to run the program against all .frag and .decaf files.

# Issues
The known issues are output issues, and some potential column/line number calculation issues.
